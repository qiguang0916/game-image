# Game Asset Visual QA

## Core rule

Judge production usability from actual pixels. A visually attractive result is not acceptable if a required hard gate is missing, failed, or unverifiable.

**Required reference:** read `references/visual-qa-contract.md`.

## Inputs

Inspect:

- generated/edited result;
- selected approved references;
- requested delta;
- hard and soft preserve rules;
- `required_hard_gates`;
- topology/reference-sufficiency facts in the Host Action Packet.

If real pixels cannot be inspected, block the run.

## Required hard-gate statuses

Use:

- `PASS`
- `FAIL`
- `NOT_VERIFIABLE`

Every required hard gate must appear in the QA report.

Overall `PASS` / `PASS_WITH_NOTES` is valid only when every required hard gate is explicitly `PASS`.

## Routing

- Localized, non-topology defect → `REPAIR_MINOR`.
- Identity/projection/silhouette or required topology/component-count failure → `REGENERATE_MAJOR`.
- Required fact `NOT_VERIFIABLE`, missing evidence, or unavailable inspection → `BLOCKED`.
- All required hard gates PASS → `PASS` or `PASS_WITH_NOTES`.

Repairs must contain minimal `repair_directives` and must protect gates that already passed.

## Boundaries

This is image QA, not CAD metrology. Do not invent dimensions or hidden structure that approved evidence does not support.

Persist QA with `templates/qa-report.toml`; the Harness validates completeness before routing.
